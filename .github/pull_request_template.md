## Important: PR Title Format

**Your PR title MUST follow Conventional Commits format:**

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
```

**Examples:**

- `feat(core): add utility functions for image optimization`
- `fix(react): resolve image loading issue in Safari`
- `docs: update installation guide`
- `feat!: change API response format` (breaking change)

**Common Types:**

- `feat:` - New feature (minor version bump)
- `fix:` - Bug fix (patch version bump)
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring without functionality changes
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Build process, dependencies, or tooling changes
- `feat!:` or `fix!:` - Breaking changes (major version bump)

**Why this matters:** We use squash merge, so your PR title becomes the final commit message that GitHub Actions uses for automatic versioning and package-specific releases.
